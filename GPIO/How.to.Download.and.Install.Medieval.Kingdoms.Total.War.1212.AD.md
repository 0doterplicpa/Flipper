In this article, we will show you how to download and install Medieval Kingdoms Total War 1212 AD on your PC. There are two main steps: downloading the mod files and activating the mod in the game launcher. Here are the detailed instructions:
 
## Step 1: Downloading the mod files
 
The mod files are available on Steam Workshop and Mod DB. You can choose either source, but we recommend using Steam Workshop for easier updates and compatibility. To download the mod files from Steam Workshop, you need to have Total War: Attila installed on your Steam account and follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the [Medieval Kingdoms 1212 AD Base Pack - Campaign Alpha](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1429109380) page on Steam Workshop[^1^]. This is the main file that contains the core features of the mod.
2. Click on the green **Subscribe** button. This will add the mod to your subscribed items and start downloading it automatically.
3. Go to your [Steam Library](steam://url/SteamIDPage/76561198034364544) and right-click on Total War: Attila. Select **Properties** and then go to the **Local Files** tab. Click on **Browse Local Files**. This will open the game folder on your PC.
4. In the game folder, go to **data** and then **mk\_1212ad\_campaign\_alpha**. You should see a file named **mk\_1212ad\_campaign\_alpha.pack**. This is the main mod file that you need to activate in the game launcher.
5. If you want to download additional optional files for the mod, such as music, sound effects, or unit upgrades, you can go back to Steam Workshop and subscribe to them as well. They are listed in the [Medieval Kingdoms Total War 1212](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1429109380) collection[^1^]. You can also find them on Mod DB[^3^]. Make sure to download only one version of each file and place them in the same folder as the main mod file.

## Step 2: Activating the mod in the game launcher
 
Once you have downloaded all the mod files that you want, you need to activate them in the game launcher. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Launch Total War: Attila from your Steam Library or desktop shortcut.
2. In the game launcher, go to **Mod Manager**. You should see a list of all the mod files that you have downloaded.
3. Select all the mod files that you want to use by clicking on their checkboxes. Make sure that **mk\_1212ad\_campaign\_alpha.pack** is at the top of the list and has a green checkmark. This is important for avoiding conflicts and crashes.
4. Click on **Play**. The game will launch with the mod activated.
5. To start a new campaign with Medieval Kingdoms Total War 1212 AD, go to **New Campaign**, then select **MK1212 Campaign Open Alpha**. You can choose from 57 playable factions and various scripted features.
